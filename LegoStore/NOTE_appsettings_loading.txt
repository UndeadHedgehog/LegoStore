Based on "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-9.0"
I did not read the whole article sadly, but currently I understand it as:
    When I create WebApplicationBuilder it looks for:        
        - command line arguments
        - environment variables  ( non prefixed )
        - secret.json
        - launchSettings.json
        - appsettings.{Environment}.json
        - appsettings.json
        
    I guess that it loads data from each source ( files above ) and tries to fill the builder with data from those sources,
    it goes from the highest priority to the lowest priority and checks whether data is present or not 
    also it checks whether I run app in Development mode which can be configured inside "launchSettings.json" located in Properties directory.
    *It's how I imagine it working, it's mainly about a result and which data builder chooses to load.
     
    Example order:
        if {data} in command line arguments:
            use it
        else if {data} in environment variables:
            use it:
        else if {data} in secret AND Development mode: 
            use it:
        else if {data} in appsettings.{Environment}.json AND {Environment} mode:
            use it:
        else if {data} in appsettings.json:
            use it:
    
    everything happens after "var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);" 
    and finishes during "var app = builder.Build();"

* secret.json is being used to store sensitive data such as password to database. This file is not located withing this project so it's impossible to commit it by mistake

! Keep in mind:
    launchSettings.json is being used only for local debugging and SHOULDN'T BE included in production
